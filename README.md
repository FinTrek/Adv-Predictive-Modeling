# Adv-Predictive-Modeling

- This repository consists of homeworks and projects in my MSBA advanced predictive modeling class

- HW1 focuses on OLS, ridge, LASSO, and cross validation 

- HW2 focuses on the Bias-Variance trade off, the number of data points required for OLS by explore empirically estimating a known data distribution, Data Imputation Strategies, and conceptually what PCA does.

- Hand-On ML goes through tutorials and examples from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
