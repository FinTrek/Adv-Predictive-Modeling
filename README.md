# Adv-Predictive-Modeling

- This repository consists of homeworks and projects in my MSBA advanced predictive modeling class

- HW1 focuses on OLS, ridge, LASSO, and cross validation 

- HW2 focuses on the Bias-Variance trade off, the number of data points required for OLS by explore empirically estimating a known data distribution, Data Imputation Strategies, and conceptually what PCA does.

- HW3 focuses on building a Class to run Stocastic Gradient Decent from scratch, the math behind SGD, the difference between SGD and second order methods like adagrad and momentum, using the tensorflow playground to understand neural networks, the basics of decision trees, and the math behind bayes optimal classifier.

- Hand-On ML goes through tutorials and examples from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
